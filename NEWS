Added a util/ directory, to which everything containing utility functions/macros will be moved. This also enables a splitup of the util.c file, which will be done in the future

Actually added some useful ANSI escape sequences to [util/]ansi-escape-sequences.h

Enabled the use of internal (inaccessible to the user of the library) structures and functions in util/*

Changed the way header files of this project are included in the source files 
    (example - file 'gui/buttons.c' including 'user-input/keyboard.h'):
        previously: #include "../user-input/mouse.h"
        now: #include <cgd/user-input/mouse.h>
This way is much more reliable and clean. All the required compiler flags were obviously added to the Makefile.

Minor bug fixes and improvements in util/util.*
