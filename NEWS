Added kb_destroyKeyboard() at the end of main
Located memory leak; turns out it was all in X11_InitKeyboard and other functions not written by me, so I have no way of fixing that
Added oe_destroyOnEventObj() macro, used it wherever it was needed
Removed unnecessary obj = NULL after calls to obj_destroyObj()
Added .gitignore
Moved the executable to a new 'bin' directory
