Dropped dependency for SDL2_image, now using libpng to load textures
oe_OnEvent->argv is now allocated on the stack instead of the heap, eliminating the need for a oe_destroyOnEventObj function
Fixed the comipilation error "initializer is not a compile time constant" in gcc < 8.2 and clang in config.h
Added assertions on every instance something is being allocated dynamically,
Added comments in source (*.c) files (except in main.c and config.h)
