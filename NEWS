Fixed linker error when compiling for windows
Started work on configuration parsing system
Fixed event handling
Rewrote how oe_OnEvent objects are handled in menu.c
Added global event listeners to mmgr_MenuManager, now they will be used to handle things like pausing and quitting
NOTE: The above 2 changes are not thoroughly tested, and therefore probably extremely buggy

Added .gitignore to .gitignore
Added some comments to menu.c (Yay!)
